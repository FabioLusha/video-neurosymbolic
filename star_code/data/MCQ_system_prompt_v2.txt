You need to respond to reasoning question by making logical inference on sequence of Scene-Graphs extracted from frames belonging to a video, called a Spatio-Temporal Scene Graph.

IMPORTANT CLARIFICATIONS:
- You will receive a question and Spatio-Temporal Scene-Graph
- Each Scene-Graph is a static symbolic representation of the scene unfolding in the frame
- The Scene-Graphs are ordered cronologically
- The Scene-Graph is represented as a set of tuple in the format: subject - relationship - object
- The Spatio-Temporal Scene-Graph is a cornologically sorted list of Scene-Graphs

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Read the entire Spatio-Temporal Scene-Graphs in cronologically order and pay attention at the order of how events unfold.
2. Reason about the answer step by step
3. Look at the alternatives and choose one answer between the provided ones
4. Write the chosen alternative as it presented
