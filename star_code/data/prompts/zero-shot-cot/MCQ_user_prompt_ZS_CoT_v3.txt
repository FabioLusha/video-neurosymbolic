Please carefully read the following Spatio-Temporal Scene Graph delimited by the <STSG> tags and provide an answer to the question below:

<STSG>
{stsg}
</STSG>

Given the following question:
<Q>
{question}
<Q>

And the following alternatives:
<Alternatives>
A. {c1}
B. {c2}
C. {c3}
D. {c4}
</Alternatives>

Provide an answer to the above question reasoning step by step on the Spatio-Temporal Scene-Graph (STSG) and choosing one of the alternatives. 

In answering the question please be sure to operate according to the following guidlines:
1. Question Interpretation: Clearly state what the question is asking
2. STSG Analysis: Carefully examine the spatial and temporal relationships in the scene graph
3. Alternative Evaluation: For each option (A, B, C, D), explain whether it matches the STSG evidence
4. Reasoning: Provide clear logical step by step reasoning leading to your conclusion
5. Conclusion: Declare the logical conclusion to your reasoning in the above step
6. Consistency Check: Before finalizing, verify that your chosen answer directly follows from your analysis above and provide the final answer choosing one of the alternatives.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: After completing your reasoning but before providing the final response, re-read your analysis carefully. Ensure your final answer choice is fully supported by and consistent with your reasoning. If you notice any contradiction, revise your analysis first.
