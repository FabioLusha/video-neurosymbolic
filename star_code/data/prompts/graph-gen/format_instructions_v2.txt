Now organize the objects and relationships you identified before into a formal scene graph using this format:
object1 ---- relationship ---- object2

The list of relationship predicates should be introduced for each frame should be introduce by the frame ID or 
name and finally by the tag <scene_graph> and terminated by the tag </scene_graph>.

For example:
Frame 0:
<scene_graph>
man ---- sitting_on ---- chair
dog ---- lying_under ---- table
book ---- on_top_of ---- shelf
...
</scene_graph>

Frame 2:
<scene_graph>
woman ---- on_the_left_of ---- man
...
<scene_graph>
...


Please follow these guidelines:
1. Create an adequate number of relationship triplets (more if the image is complex)
2. Use specific and consistent object labels
3. Use concise but descriptive relationship terms (connect words with underscores)
4. Include all meaningful relationships between objects
5. Verify that all objects you identified in step 1 appear in at least one relationship
6. You can condense multiple visual frames and their descriptions into a single or few frames 
   if they contains the same or similar repetitive relationships. In doing so be careful to preserve
   the temporal end spatial relationship and the events unfolding in the video.
