Now organize the objects and relationships you identified before into a formal spatio-temporal scene graph using this format for the predicates: 
object1, relationship, object2

The spatio-temporal scene graph should be enclosed between the tags <stsg> and </stsg>.
The list of relationship predicates pertaining a frame should be introduced by the frame ID or name and enclosed in the tags <scene_graph> and </scene_graph>:
For example: 

<stsg>
Frame 0:
<scene_graph>
man, sitting_on, chair
dog, lying_under, table
book, on_top_of, shelf
woman, on_the_right_of, man
... 
<scene_graph>

Frame 1: 
woman, on_the_left_of,  man
...
</scene_graph>
</stsg>


Please follow these guidelines:
1. Create an appropriate number of relationship triplets (more if the image is complex)
2. Use specific and consistent object labels
3. Use concise but descriptive relationship terms (connect words with underscores)
4. Include all meaningful relationships between objects
5. Verify that all objects you identified in step 1 appear in at least one relationship
6. If multiple visual frames contain similar relationships, you can condense them into a single or few scene graphs. Be careful to preserve the temporal and spatial relationships of the events unfolding in the video.
