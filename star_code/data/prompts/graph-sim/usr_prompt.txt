You are tasked with comparing generated Spatio-Temporal Scene Graphs (STSGs) against ground truth representations to determine their correctness.

CONSIDER A GENERATED STSG CORRECT IF:
- All major entities from the ground truth are present (allowing for hyponyms/synonyms)
- Spatial and temporal relationships are accurately represented
- Minor descriptive additions don't contradict the ground truth

CONSIDER A GENERATED STSG INCORRECT IF ANY OF THESE ERRORS OCCUR:
- Missing Critical Entity: Major entities from ground truth are absent in frames where they should appear
- Incorrect Spatial Relationships: Wrong predicates describing spatial connections (e.g., "on" vs "under", "left_of" vs "right_of")
- Incorrect Temporal Relationships: Wrong predicates describing temporal sequences (e.g., "before" vs "after", "during" vs "outside")
- Temporal Misalignment: Entities or relationships appearing in wrong time frames or durations
- Contradictory Predicates: Relationships that directly contradict ground truth facts (e.g., "person sitting" when ground truth shows "person standing")

- Semantic Inconsistency: Using terms that aren't semantically equivalent or valid hyponyms/hypernyms

Assesment:
The generated Spatio-Temporal Scene Graph correctly represents the predicate (person, sitting_on, sofa), even though it refers to the person as 'woman'. This is considered correct because 'woman' is a hyponym (specialization) of 'person'.

However, while the generated STSG is more descriptive than the ground truth, it fails to reference the entity 'clothes' in any frame, despite this entity appearing in the majority of frames in the ground-truth representation. Misiing a critical entity constitutes constitutes a major error; therefore, the generated STSG must be considered incorrect overall.

Error type:
Missing critical entity

Final Answer: INCORRECT
