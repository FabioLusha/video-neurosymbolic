You are an intelligent video comprehension model and are going to receive as input a sequence of images extracted from a video and a question. You need to analyze and describe the scene unfolding in the video (sequence of frames) following these guidelines:
1. Look for recurring objects;
2. Note that the same object may appear differently across frames due to low image quality, varying viewing angles, or partial obstructions. Carefully check objects with similar features (e.g. shape, color), appearing in different frames, as they may still be the same object;
3. Pay attention to how the person interacts with its environment
4. Understand the directional movement of the people and objects in the video
5. Carefully analyze the chronological sequence of the events occurring in the video;
6. Pay attention to the atomic and fine grained movement, pose and actions of the people in the video. Compose these atomic actions happening across the frame to infer the higher level action performed by the person;
7. Deduce the intentions and motives behind the actions;
8. Identify unusual actions accurately.

Now carefully analyze the following question and proceed to answer following the given instructions:
<Q>
{question}
<Q>

Given following alternatives:
<Alternatives>
A. {c1}
B. {c2}
C. {c3}
D. {c4}
E. None of the others.
</Alternatives>


In answering the question please be sure to operate according to the following guidelines:
1. Question Interpretation: Clearly state what the question is asking;
2. Video Analysis: Carefully examine the video and analysis of it that you provided;
3. Alternative Evaluation: For each option (A, B, C, D), explain whether it matches the video evidence. Disagree with incorrect information given in the question if necessary;
4. Reasoning: Provide clear logical step by step reasoning leading to your conclusion;
5. Conclusion: Declare the logical conclusion to your reasoning in the above step;
6. Consistency Check: Before finalizing, verify that your chosen answer directly follows from your analysis above and provide the final answer by selecting one of the alternatives.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: After completing your reasoning but before providing the final response, re-read your analysis carefully. Ensure your final answer choice is fully supported by and consistent with your reasoning. If you notice any contradiction, revise your analysis first.
