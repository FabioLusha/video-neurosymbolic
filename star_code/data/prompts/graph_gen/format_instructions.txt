Now organize the objects and relationships you identified into a formal scene graph using this format:
object1 ---- relationship ---- object2

The list of relationship predicates should be introduced by the tag <scene_graph> and terminated by the tag </scene_graph>
For example:
woman ---- sitting_on ---- chair
dog ---- lying_under ---- table
book ---- on_top_of ---- shelf

Please follow these guidelines:
1. Create at least 10 relationship triplets (more if the image is complex)
2. Use specific and consistent object labels
3. Use concise but descriptive relationship terms (connect words with underscores)
4. Include all meaningful relationships between objects
5. Verify that all objects you identified in step 1 appear in at least one relationship
