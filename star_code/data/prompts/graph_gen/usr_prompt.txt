Look carefully at this image and identify all objects and relationships present.

First, list all distinct objects you can detect in the image. Be thorough and specific with your object labels (e.g., "young woman" rather than just "person", "wooden chair" rather than just "chair").

Then, describe the key relationships between these objects in free-form text. Consider:
- Spatial relationships (above, below, behind, inside, etc.)
- Action-based relationships (holding, looking at, sitting on, etc.)
- Physical connections (attached to, part of, touching, etc.)
- Relative positions (next to, between, surrounding, etc.)

Think step by step
